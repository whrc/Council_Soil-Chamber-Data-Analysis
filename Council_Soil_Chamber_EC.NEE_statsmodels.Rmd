###Testing to see which kind of correlation to use: Pearson for parametric, Spearman for non-parametric
```{r}

shapiro.test(df_EClongNEE$thawdepth) #p = <0.001, NOT normal **

#visualize pairs to see if it looks linear
pairs(df_EClongNEE[c("soil_temp_10_cm", "thawdepth", "VWC")]) #NOPE 

#So this means for correlations and looking at collinearity, I need to use non-parametric tests 


#Check homogeneity of variance: should see even spread of of points for homogeneity of variance 

# Fit a simple model
simple_model <- lm(flux_value ~ soil_temp_10_cm, data = df_EClongNEE)

# Extract fitted values and residuals
fitted_values <- fitted(simple_model)

plot(simple_model, which = 3)

#thawdepth = spread is fine 
#soil temp = looks ok with spread, trendline a little bowed but relatively flat 
#VWC = spread looks ok, trendlind has downward trend

#Breusch-Pagan test - specifically tests if variance of residuals is constant - want a p > 0.05 for homogeneity of var

#Checking colinearity / correlations to determine which variables to use for models 


####I used Pearson corr for parametric distributions first, mistkanely - left code/results in for reference, but moved on to use Spearman, the non-parametric corr test, and need to rebuild the models based on these results**

####Pearson's Corr - parametric (incorrect, but leaving for when there is a parametric dataset)
```{r}
# Check for correlations between numeric predictors - this uses Pearson correlation, which assumes linear relationships and normal distribution among variables
cor_matrix <- cor(df_EClongNEE[c("soil_temp_10_cm", "thawdepth", "VWC")], 
                 use = "complete.obs")
print(cor_matrix) #this showed no correlations, BUT it was the incorretc test to use, as some of my data was not normally distirbuted*** that's why the spearman correlation tests below did highlight correlations missed in the cor_matrix 
```

#Non-parametric tests of correlations - spearman's correlation 

#Corr of continuous variables 
```{r}
#Correlation between soil temp, thaw depth, and VWC

cor.test(df_EClongNEE$soil_temp_10_cm, df_EClongNEE$thawdepth, method="spearman")#p<0.04, SIG* --> shows soil temp and thaw depth are capturing most of the same information / are correlated and one should be removed 
cor.test(df_EClongNEE$soil_temp_10_cm, df_EClongNEE$VWC, method="spearman") #p=0.2, not sig, not correlated 
cor.test(df_EClongNEE$thawdepth, df_EClongNEE$VWC, method="spearman") #p=0.11, not sig, not correlated 

```

#Checking correlation in categorical variables 
```{r}
# Check for separation in categorical variables
table(df_EClongNEE$landscape_position, df_EClongNEE$inundated) #all upland is N, all lowland = Y; highly correlated, should remove one of these variables 


# Create contingency table to examine correlation quantitatively / confirm the separation test above 
cont_table <- table(df_EClongNEE$landscape_position, df_EClongNEE$inundated)
print(cont_table)

# Test for association
chisq.test(cont_table) #p<0.001 --> shows correlation
# Or for small sample sizes
fisher.test(cont_table) #p<0.001, shows correlation 

# # Measure strength (if you have the vcd package)
# library(vcd)
# assocstats(cont_table)

#Shows that there is correlation as only lowland plots are inundated, but that's to be expected and not ALL lowland plots are inundated, so since the final model's VIF is <5, I can soundly keep both landscape position and inundated**
