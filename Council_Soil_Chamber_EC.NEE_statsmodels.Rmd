####Testing models for EC NEE -- dataset already in complete cases for EC 
####Testing whether random effect plot_ID should be included or not 
```{r}
#Make plot_ID, inundated, landscape_position as factor so they'll work with gls
df_EClongNEE$plot_ID = factor(df_EClongNEE$plot_ID)
df_EClongNEE$landscape_position = factor(df_EClongNEE$landscape_position)

#use 'ML' for comparing models 
library(nlme)
#gls - no random effect
gls.EC.NEE = gls(flux_value ~  landscape_position + inundated + soil_temp_10_cm + thawdepth + VWC, data = df_EClongNEE, method = 'ML') #, na.action=na.exclude) --> don't need, already made dataset with complete cases
anova(gls.EC.NEE) #sig diff in landpos, p = 0.02

lme.EC.NEE <- lme(flux_value ~ landscape_position + inundated + soil_temp_10_cm + thawdepth + VWC, 
               random = ~1 | plot_ID,

#Comparing the models 
anova(gls.EC.NEE, lme.EC.NEE) #p = 0.3, no improvement to model with random effect - so plot_ID random effect *NOT needed here 

```

####Multicollinearity in model- EC.NEE
```{r}
#variance inflation factor (vif) - vif = 1 = variables are not correlated; between 1 & 5 = moderately correlated,  5 or higher indicates highly correlated & multicollinearity among variables. GVIF is a generalized VIF for categorical variables with more than two levels; the adj VIF gives values for comparing across variables with diff degrees of freedom* --> look at both when assessing collinearity in a model 
library(car)
vif(gls.EC.NEE) # all variables ~2 or less, no impactful multicollinearity 
```

#### Variance Structre
```{r}
#testing variance structure - using only categorical variables here, not numeric (soil temp, thawdepth, VWC)

#Check sample size by group
table(df_EClongNEE$landscape_position, df_EClongNEE$inundated)

#based on inundation --> can't use this var structure due to small sample size in levels 
# var.EC.NEE.inundated = update(gls.EC.NEE, weights = varIdent(form = ~1|inundated))

anova(var.EC.NEE.landpos) #no diffs among variables 
anova(gls.EC.NEE, var.EC.NEE.landpos) #p = <0.0001, adding in the variance by inundation significantly improves the model fit (but only slightly lower AIC, lower BIC, and higher LogLik)


#now testing which models are best fit 
anova(gls.EC.NEE, var.EC.NEE.landpos) #p=0.033, so var structure = sig improvement, but the differences in AIC/BIC/LogLik are very small. will test both models and see how they do...
