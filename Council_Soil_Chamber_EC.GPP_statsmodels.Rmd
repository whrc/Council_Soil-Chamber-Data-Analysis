###Testing to see which kind of correlation to use: Pearson for parametric, Spearman for non-parametric

#visualize pairs to see if it looks linear
pairs(df_EClongGPP[c("soil_temp_10_cm", "thawdepth", "VWC")]) #NOPE 

#So this means for correlations and looking at collinearity, I need to use non-parametric tests 


#Check homogeneity of variance: should see even spread of of points for homogeneity of variance 

# Fit a simple model

#Checking colinearity / correlations to determine which variables to use for models 


####I used Pearson corr for parametric distributions first, mistkanely - left code/results in for reference, but moved on to use Spearman, the non-parametric corr test, and need to rebuild the models based on these results**

####Pearson's Corr - parametric (incorrect, but leaving for when there is a parametric dataset)
```{r}
# Check for correlations between numeric predictors - this uses Pearson correlation, which assumes linear relationships and normal distribution among variables -> thawdepth was the not-normal continuous variable here 
cor_matrix <- cor(df_EClongGPP[c("soil_temp_10_cm", "thawdepth", "VWC")], 
                 use = "complete.obs")
print(cor_matrix) #this showed no correlations, BUT it was the incorre test to use, as some of my data was not normally distributed*** that's why the spearman correlation tests below did highlight correlations missed in the cor_matrix 
```

#Non-parametric tests of correlations - spearman's correlation 

#Corr of continuous variables 
```{r}
#Correlation between soil temp, thaw depth, and VWC

cor.test(df_EClongGPP$soil_temp_10_cm, df_EClongGPP$thawdepth, method="spearman")#p<0.047, marginally SIG* --> shows soil temp and thaw depth may be correlated 
cor.test(df_EClongGPP$soil_temp_10_cm, df_EClongGPP$VWC, method="spearman") #p=0.2, not sig, not correlated 
cor.test(df_EClongGPP$thawdepth, df_EClongGPP$VWC, method="spearman") #p=0.11, not sig, not correlated 

```

#Checking correlation in categorical variables 
```{r}
# Check for separation in categorical variables
table(df_EClongGPP$landscape_position, df_EClongGPP$inundated) #all inun in lowland, but not all lowland is inun


# Create contingency table to examine correlation quantitatively / confirm the separation test above 
cont_table <- table(df_EClongGPP$landscape_position, df_EClongGPP$inundated)
print(cont_table)

# Test for association
chisq.test(cont_table) #p<0.02 --> shows correlation
# Or for small sample sizes
fisher.test(cont_table) #p<0.01, shows correlation 


#Shows that there is correlation as only lowland plots are inundated, but that's to be expected and not ALL lowland plots are inundated, so since the final model's VIF is <5, I can soundly keep both landscape position and inundated**

```{r}
#variance inflation factor (vif) - vif = 1 = variables are not correlated; between 1 & 5 = moderately correlated,  5 or higher indicates highly correlated & multicollinearity among variables.

#now testing which models are best fit
